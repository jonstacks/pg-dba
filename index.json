	"content": "The motivation for pg-dba is to automate Postgres administation. We often found that our tables were becoming bloated and the number of dead tuples was large despite our best efforts at using the auto_vacuum and auto_analyze features of postgres.\nFurthermore, we often found ourselves running a SQL script to find the tables that were bloated and then selectively running FULL VACUUM on them. Some tables are just too large to run a FULL VACUUM on since it would lock the table for too long and take down an app for too long.\nWith this in mind, we created pg-dba. While still in its infancy, it has helped to make the task of keeping our tables performing much easier and anyone on a team can run it without having to have much knowledge about what is happening under the hood. This program could even be run on a cron during a scheduled maintenance window to help keep your DB performing at its best.\n"
